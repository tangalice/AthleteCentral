Problem Statement
High school and collegiate student athletes and coaches currently lack a centralized, secure, and user-friendly platform to record performance, monitor progress, and manage availability. This gap makes it more difficult to efficiently track data, provide timely feedback, and make informed team lineup decisions, especially when injuries occur. Most existing athlete/coach apps have features limited to logging workouts and tracking progress, our Athlete Central Application is geared towards competitive athletes and has features to predict future performance. This software aims to bridge the gap between coaches and athletes, as well as athletes with their fellow teammates, allowing them to keep track of their progress and make realistic goals for themselves based on algorithmic-based predictions.
